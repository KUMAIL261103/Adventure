            <p class="text">Adventure tourism is one of the fastest growing segments, and that’s for food reason. In the past few years, popularity
            for adventure sports has grown significantly in urban areas, and people are looking at more than just fun. In fact,
            adventure sports have several benefits other than giving you an adrenaline rush. Here are some major ones:
            <br><br>
            Each human being has certain phobias within them, be it known or unknown. Some of the most common phobias included that
            of height, water, falling, etc. Taking part in adventure sports is a great option to tackle and overcome these fears.
            Activities like Swoop Swing, Flying Fox, and Sky Cycling are apt for beating acrophobia. Other adventure sports like
            Rappelling, High Rope Challenges, Water Zorbing, etc help in overcoming various other fears. </p>

            <p class="text">Motocross can be a non-stop, full-body, high-heart rate workout, as well as an exercise in muscle strength and aerobic
            endurance as busting through soil and ruts alone can knock you around and tire you out.
                <br><br>
                Just like cycling, motocross can help you build a base, and strengthen your aerobic energy system.
                Motocross riders are some of the most physically fit and mentally tough athletes on the planet. Core strength,
                flexibility, mobility, recovery and repetition are all essential in Motocross, making it a sport ripe for crossover
                training and direct skill transfer to other sports if not overall fitness level.

                <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Imagine how it feels to sense the air breeze on your face, how it feels to see the uninterrupted 360-degree astonishing
            views of the landscape around you as the birds do. Imagine yourself dancing through the skies as you experience human
            flight in its purest form
                <br><br>
                Apart from being an extremely fun and unforgettable experience which gives you the chance to see the world through
                different eyes. Furthermore, it gives you the opportunity of making great new friendships or experiencing the
                incomparable feeling of flying. But, besides that, you will have the chance to experience a wide range of positive both
                physical and mental health benefits of paragliding

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing originated in Hawaii. These days, people surf all over the world – wherever there is a wave. Australia has
            almost 40,000 kilometres of coastline, with many surf beaches. Surfers enjoy the physical benefits of paddling and
            surfing, being in the fresh air, as well as the overall benefits of surfing.
                <br><br>
            Surfing provides many health benefits including:
            cardiovascular fitness – from paddling
            shoulder and back strength – these muscles will strengthen from the paddling
            leg and core strength – once you’re standing up on the board, strong legs and a strong core will keep you up     </p>
